      <meta name="description" content="The meteoric rise of the price of bitcoin, and its accompanying wild fluctuations, has piqued
the interest of many investors and speculators. Cryptocurrency has often been hyped as a goldlike replacement for fiat currencies by virtue of its “finite” supply. There have been many
publicised stories of the early stage “miners” who “solved puzzles” (as they put it) on their
computers to “mine” bitcoin early on, who then went on to cash-out with spectacular windfalls.
The underlying “blockchain” technology and proposed applications designed to be built “on the
blockchain” also received much attention and, reportedly, investor funding. This paper will first
attempt to clarify these terms, explain some of their working based on the author’s research,
and then examine these claims. It will attempt to answer a simple question: where does the
actual “value” for a unit of crypto come from? This should help both potential investors and
users of applications based on these concepts to make more informed decisions.
